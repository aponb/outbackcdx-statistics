# OutbackCDX statistics collector

A tool to collect statistics for WARC files indexed in OutbackCDX

## Usage

```
./outbackcdx-statistics.pl [<options>]
```

Details on the `<options>` can be found by

```
./outbackcdx-statistics.pl --help
```

## Description

Fetches the OutbackCDX index and prints the number and size of stored objects for each
collection, month, top level domain, 2nd level domain, content-type and file extension.

Collection names are read from the OutbackCDX data directory unless given as arguments.

May optionally re-calculate previously collected data read from a CSV-file.

## Reason

The [National Library of Sweden](https://www.kb.se/) has [collected and archived web
sites](https://www.kb.se/hitta-och-bestall/hitta-i-samlingarna/kulturarw3.html) in the
`.se` top level domain since 1997. This tool was created to summarize statistics about
the collected data. Since other tools already created didn't fit our needs without
extra tooling we decided to create our own. For one thing the tools we found uses JSON
as output format which gives smaller file sizes compared to CSV but at the expense of
execution speed and memory consumption.

If someone else finds this tool useful we're happy to share - see below.
